Welcome to the Titanic Survival Prediction Adventure! In this GitHub repository, you'll embark on a journey to predict the survival of passengers aboard the legendary RMS Titanic. You'll use Python and machine learning to uncover who survived this historic maritime disaster.

## The Tale of Titanic

_Once upon a time, on a fateful night in 1912, the grand ship Titanic set sail on its maiden voyage. But tragedy struck as the ship struck an iceberg and began to sink. Amidst the chaos, the fate of passengers depended on various factors, including age, gender, fare, and more._

## Your Mission

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on these crucial factors. To embark on this adventure, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

To start your adventure, clone this repository to your local machine. Open your terminal and use this command:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/your-username/titanic-survival-prediction.git
```

### Step 2: Prepare Your Tools

Ensure you have the necessary tools in your detective toolkit:

- **Python**: Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

- **Dependencies**: Install the required Python packages (Pandas and scikit-learn) using pip:

   ```shell
   pip install pandas scikit-learn
   ```

### Step 3: Unravel the Titanic Mystery

Now, it's time to dive into the heart of the Titanic mystery. Run the `titanic_prediction.py` script to:

- Load and prepare the training and test datasets.
- Train a Random Forest Classifier to uncover patterns in the data.
- Predict the survival of passengers in the test dataset.
- Create a CSV file named `titanic_predictions_py.csv` with your findings.

Execute the script with this command:

```shell
python titanic_prediction.py
```

### Step 4: The Revelation

Once the script completes its mission, you'll find yourself holding the key to the Titanic's secrets. Open `titanic_predictions_py.csv` to reveal which passengers you predict to have survived.
